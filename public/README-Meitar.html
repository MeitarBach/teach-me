			<h2>What Was Hard To Do?</h2>
			<p>
				Overall this project has been very challenging and constructive. This is the first time I've built an application from scratch including both front and back ends.<br>
				Understanding how to orchestrate between them, while sending data back and forth and using a DB was very challenging.<br>
				Another challenging part was getting the pages to look like we wanted them to using css. Executing our vision and designing it with code proved to be a hard task.

			<br><h2>Who is your partner?  name and id. What did you do? What did your partner do?</h2>
			<p>
				My partener is Mai Elenberg - 316265974.<br>
				Most of the time we worked on the project together as we both wanted to gain experience in every aspect of the job - front/server sides + working with redis.<br>
				As we caught the hang of it we divided some of the work load between us -<br>
				Mai dealt with pages that were tricky to design, like individual user's purchase history page, admin's view of users' personal details and activity-log page.<br>
				Mai also implemented DOS security using rate-limiter and wrote most of the testing script by herself.<br>
				I took on the job of implementing some of the user functionalities we haven't already developed together - Adding/Deleting a lesson to/from the cart, Registering as a teacher, Uploading a class + individual class view, User's cart and Checkout pages.<br>
				I also implemented the search functionality for filtering the lessons on our main store page.

			<h2>How Did You Make Your Code Secure?</h2>
			<p>
				We used express-rate-limit library to prevent DOS attacks.<br>
				The rate limiter makes sure we get a maximum of 30 requests every second from the same ip address.<br>
				We set the cookies we send our users to expire after 30 minutes to prevent session hi-jacking (unless the user specifies he wishes to be remembered).<br>
				We protected most of our routes with a checkSignIn method, making sure only logged in users can send requests to the server.<br>
				We wrote our redis accessing code while making sure it isn't susceptible to malicious code injection 'using the front door'.

			<br><h2>Did You Implement The Store Using React.js??</h2>
			<p> No, we used EJS template engine </p>
