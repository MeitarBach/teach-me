			<h2>What Was Hard To Do?</h2>
			<p>
				The hardest part for me was to understand and gain the fullstack developer perspective and understand which parts of the code should be handled at either front or backend.
				Another challenging part was to understand how to use the Redis databse. That includes choosing the right package to install and work with, as we wanted to implement the async await funcionality<br>
				and also to decide what would be the best structure to store and hold the information that we have to keep.<br>
				Another aspect that was quite challenging was generally working with all the different design modules and libraries for the first time, some very small visual frontend details took us plenty of time to implement.
